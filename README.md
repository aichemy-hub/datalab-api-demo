# Datalab API Demo

This repo contains scripts demonstrating how to use [datalab-api](https://github.com/datalab-org/datalab-api) to add automated experimental data to our Datalab instance at http://aichemy-datalab.ch.ic.ac.uk/.

The experimental data is from the paper **[Streamlining the automated discovery of porous organic cages](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2024/sc/d3sc06133g)**. 

To run the scripts:

- Download the research data from [10.5281/zenodo.10138084](https://zenodo.org/records/14078250) 
- Unzip it 
- Set `DATA_DIR =` to point to the unzipped directory in batch_addition_workflow/config.py.
